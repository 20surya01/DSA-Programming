linked list is a linear data structure that store our list of value (similar to array)

Array                                          linked list
single block of memory with           multiple blocks of memory linked to each   
partitions                            other
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 7 |                 |1|-|2|-|3|-|5|-|7|

for start and end of linked list we store the adress of first to HEAD =10k
similary for end we store NULL .
